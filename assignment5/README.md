Handling User Input
===================

In the previous assignments, we looked at C's syntax for variables and arithmetic operations, control flow, and arrays. However, none of the programs we wrote were interactive â€“ they simply performed some calculation and printed out the same answer every time. If we want to write programs that are actually useful, we're going to want some way for the user to input data to our programs. In this section, we'll look at some simple methods of handling input from the user. We'll discuss more advanced ways to work with input later, but this should be enough to get us started writing interactive programs.
