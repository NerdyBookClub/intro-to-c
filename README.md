A few notes before we get started
---------------------------------

Most of my instructions assume a Unix or Unix-like operating system. If you're on Windows, you will need Cygwin or something similar. Unfortunately, I don't know a great deal about Cygwin, but if you can't figure out how to do something, we can try to puzzle through it together.

The names of command-line programs, programming language statements, and source code blocks are written in `this font`. The dollar sign character (`$`) is a convention for the command prompt. A phrase in the code font beginning with a dollar sign means 'type this at the command line'. You don't type the dollar sign character; it stands in for whatever your prompt says.

Since we're hosting all of the code and assignments on GitHub, you will want to have a decent working knowledge of Git. If you need to brush up on Git basics, GitHub has a pretty good [interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) you may want to run throuh.
